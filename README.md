RICSconverter
=============

A simple Java GUI application designed to integrate conflicting inventory systems. Combs a .txt file generated by an Opticon 2001 UPC scan gun, then reformats it to be compatible with a feature in Retail Inventory Control System (RICS) that allows external inventory files to be uploaded

Oh, the joys of working in retail.
